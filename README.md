# Let's text some babes
Run command: python Texter.py

Arguments: none

Requirements:
- input file with name of your choosing (just make sure to change it in the code), formatted like the "PressOneMasterSendList" (I mean really it just needs row[5] to be a telephone but whatevs)
- blank csv called "Sendlist.csv" - which will fill with contacts as you text them, basically a cache. Clean it out only when sending a new bit of text
- a message (put in the code) that you know looks okay as a text
- some Twilio credentials (you may need to replace the "import credentials" with your version)
